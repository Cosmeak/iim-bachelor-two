# IIM Bachelor - Year Two

This repository contain all my project from my second year at [IIM](https://www.iim.fr/) (Institute of Internet and Multimedia).

Each repository contain a README with it own explanation about the project. You can take the time to check it all. BUT I advise you to not use them in production or other things, they are only made for the purpose of learning.

For each of the projects we had a week to carry them out.

## Brief description of each project

### 1 - Learn how to use Git

For this project we need to create a little chrome browser extension to redesign our student portal (It's really ugly). We need to understand how git work and setup it. We were marked on the quality of our commits and the understanding we had of it.
