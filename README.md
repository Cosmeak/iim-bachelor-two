## About the developpement

This website use [**SWAPI API**](https://swapi.dev/) for all wiki categories but the images was stocked in our server because this api doesn't have it.
We also use [**funtranslations API**](https://api.funtranslations.com/) to translate a text in a language of star wars universe.

This website is coded with Javascript, html and scss. If you need to improve my code, git clone this project and do a pull request. 
I will accept it with pleasure!
